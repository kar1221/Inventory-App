# Inventory Application

From the odin project

Made in NuxtJS simply because I like vue more.

Before using this, set the following enviroment variable:

- `DATABASE_URL` Postgresql database url
- `JWT_SECRET` A random password for jwt authorization.
- `ADMIN_USER` Admin username for mutating database data.
- `ADMIN_PASS` Admin password

Don't ask why don't I implement a proper user database instead.
I just think it's unnecessary when you will have only one account anyways.
